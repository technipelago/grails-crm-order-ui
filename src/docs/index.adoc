== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Order Management User Interface Plugin

The `crm-order-ui` plugin is a companion plugin to the `crm-order` plugin.
It provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for order management.

=== Search orders

To query for orders you visit `crmIndex/index` which will show the query form.

You can enter query values in any field and then hit the `Search` button to search for orders matching your query.
If you don't enter any query value all orders will be included in the search result.

If the query result contains more than one order, an order list will be displayed. If the query result contains
exactly one order, then details for that order will be displayed.
I.e. it will skip the `list` view and go directly to the `show` view.

You can click on any order to show details for that order.

The `Export` button shows the *print/export* page but no layouts are provided by this plugin.
You must add an event `@Listener` in an application service that listens for the *crmOrder.exportLayout* event and return layout definitions.
Look at https://github.com/technipelago/grails-crm-order-ui/blob/master/grails-app/controllers/grails/plugins/crm/order/CrmOrderController.groovy#L202[the source^] for `CrmOrderController#export()` for more information.

=== Order details

The order details page `crmOrder/show` show all details for an order.
Here you will find order number, customer name, invoice and delivery addresses and more.

If the `crm-tags` plugin is installed you can see existing tags and add new tags to an order.

=== Edit order details

To edit order details you hit the `Edit` button. This will display the edit page `crmOrder/edit`.
Here you can alter values and then hit `Save` to store the new values in the database.

Order items are listed on a separate tab. Items can be edited, added and deleted from this tab.
